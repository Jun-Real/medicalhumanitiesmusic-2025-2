# Auditory Hallucination

In Kill me heal me (2015), The song “Auditory Hallucination” shows the confusion and fear of someone with dissociative identity disorder. The lyrics describe hidden voices inside oneself, and the repeating melody gives a sense of being trapped in one’s own mind. The overlapping vocals blur the line between reality and illusion, expressing the struggle to understand who the real self is.
